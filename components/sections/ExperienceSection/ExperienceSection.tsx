        My first contact with programming was during my time at the University
        of Technology, where I was introduced to the fundamentals of coding.
        <BreakLine />
        However, over the past{' '}
        {new Date().getFullYear() - learingSince.getFullYear()} years, I&apos;ve
        delved deeper into the world of programming and web technologies,
        expanding my skills.
        <BreakLine />
        During this time, I have gained knowledge not only in frontend
        technologies but also in various other aspects of the programming
        ecosystem. This journey has made me realize that I&apos;m just at the
        beginning, with much more to learn and discover ahead.
